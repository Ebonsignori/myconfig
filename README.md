# myconfig

This is my personal configuration to follow when setting up a new machine or server dev environment. If doing a non-gui env setup or setting up an existing desktop env with nvim, follow the instructions from [Terminal](#terminal) and ignore the [OS Steps](#os-steps) section. Otherwise start with [OS Steps](#os-steps) and then do the [Terminal](#terminal) set up.

## Terminal

Clone this repo into `~/Projects`

The desired workflow of this project is to make changes to configurations in [dotfiles](./dotfiles) in this project and to copy and replace local configurations with the changes. This way this project serves as myconfig's source of truth. The expections to this are directories/files that are manually backed up. See [Manual Backup](#manual-backup/restore).

For automatic replacement after update, we need to export a variable pointing to where this repo is cloned to and run the [init.sh](./init.sh) script.

We do this by adding the following lines to the end of your `~/.zshrc` or `~/.bashrc` **after** installing the [Prereqs](#prereqs) below.

```
# Load myconfig profile *NOTE:* Place at bottom of .zshrc
export MY_CONFIG_PROJECT_DIR=~/Projects/myconfig
export MY_CONFIG_AUTO_OVERWRITE=true 
source $MY_CONFIG_PROJECT_DIR/init.sh
```

Optionally you can require confirmation prompts when overriding config files:

```
export MY_CONFIG_AUTO_OVERWRITE=false  
```

## System

For any hardware setup steps

### Keyboard

[Online Ergodox Layout](https://configure.zsa.io/ergodox-ez/layouts/VYRM4/latest/0)

[Archived Layout if zsa goes offline](./system/ergodox_layout.hex)


## Manual Backup / Restore

If on new setup, copy directories below per instructions, otherwise to backup directories run `sh backup.sh`.

- `./dotfiles/coc` to `~/.config/coc`. Only copy snippets folder and mru's. If copying entire folder will need to custom `npm i`. Installing coc via nvim `:PlugInstall` first and then copying over needed files is recommended.
